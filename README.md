METHOD 1 : SIMPLE PERCENTAGE CALCULATION
Dataset used for method 1: Titanic.csv


METHOD 2 : BASIC DATA ANALYSIS OF WHICH PEOPLE MOST LIKELY SURVIVED (GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF DATA)
Dataset used for method 2 : train.csv, test.csv

Compiler: JupyterNotebook

Get the Titanic data set on Canvas (or find a different copy). This data set has been over studied, over analyzed. The questions:

Which people most likely survived? 

Young/Old/Middle?

Female/Male?

Rich/Poor?

Use some of the techniques/methods in Chap 2 (and Chap 3 or 1) in the text (or notes) to try to answer these questions.

METHOD 1: SIMPLE PERCENTAGE CALCULATION
 

METHOD 2: BASIC DATA ANALYSIS OF WHICH PEOPLE MOST LIKELY SURVIVED (GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF DATA)

-Basic Data Analysis, feature engineering, and used some of the popular models for prediction. 

-Predicted whether a passenger survived or not. 0 for not surviving, 1 for surviving.

-Step 1,2, & 3: Import Basic Libraries, Reading the data, & Data Exploration.

-Step 4: Feature Engineering

-Step 5: Data preprocessing for model

-Step 6: Model Deployment
 


-Therefore, the accuracy of the models is: 

-Logistic regression: 82.2%

-K Nearest Neighbour: 81.4%

-SVC: 83.3%

-Naive Bayes: 72.2% 

-Random Forest: 80.2% 

-Decision Tree: 77.7%
